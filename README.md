# Excursion
Codecademy Excursion Project
In this project, I’ll create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.”

The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so I’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

To complete this project, I used HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git and GitHub.
